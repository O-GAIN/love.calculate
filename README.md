This is a very simple project we created in our first semister of our engineering.  Got a random stupid idea so We just tried this for fun with whatever we knew in python at that time. 
Clearly you can see it wasn't much but this is where the journy began. We all have to start from somewhere.

## Legacy Branch

The **'legacy'** is made to preserve this memory. Any new features we want to add will be done on other branches.
